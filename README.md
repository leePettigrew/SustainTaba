All experiments for this project were implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. The main script (loan_run.py) performs the full experimental pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, fairness analysis, and figure generation. The dataset files (train.csv and test.csv) are included alongside the script. Running the script automatically produces the experimental outputs used in this report, including model_metrics.csv, fairness_gender.csv, fairness_education.csv, and the figures fig_f1_by_model.png, fig_accuracy_vs_time.png, and fig_pred_approval_by_gender.png. The project can be reproduced on any system with Python 3 and standard libraries installed (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib) by running the command python loan_run.py from the project directory.
